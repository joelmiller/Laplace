This means that we can safely invert the transform if we know the function must be continuous.  Since the solutions to a differential equation will always be continuous, we can be confident that the final answers we get from the Laplace Transform are unique.\n",

    "It can happen that two piecewise continuous functions $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ might have the same Laplace Transform, but not be equal to one another.  However, this only happens at discrete points where a function is discontinuous.  From a physical point of view this distinction is irrelevant: if a switch is off for $t<3$ and on for $t>3$, it doesn't actually have any impact whether we say it is on or off for the instantaneous moment of $0$ duration at $t=3$.  We will gloss over this point and treat two functions as identical if they differ only at points of discontinuity.\n",
