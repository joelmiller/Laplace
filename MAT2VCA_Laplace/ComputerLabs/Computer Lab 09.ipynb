    "# Computer Lab 09  --   Work done moving through a vector field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will explore the concept of work done by a vector field (e.g., a gravitational field or a magnetic field) on an object.  Because this vector field is applying force on the object, we will refer to it as a *force field*.  The magnitude and direction of the force at a point is given by the corresponding vector.  We will make the simplifying assumption that the force field is steady --- it may have different values at different points in space, but its values do not change in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to introduce a concept that I (Joel) use to make this intuitive.  I have not previously tried this out with students, so I would appreciate feedback on whether this makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We imagine that we have a moving object which has kinetic energy.  It also has a battery and some steering mechanism so that it can choose its own path through the force field.  If it needs to speed up, it uses energy from its battery.  If it needs to slow down, it charges its battery using its kinetic energy.  The force field is applying a force on the object.  This will cause it to gain or lose energy (depending on whether the force field is aligned with or against the direction of motion).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The *work done* by the force field on the object as it moves along a path is the net change in the combined battery energy and kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-life example of an object that has similar properties to this idealization is an electric vehicle which charges its batteries when it brakes.  As an electric vehicle goes down a hill, it is gaining energy from gravity.  Even if it is maintaining a constant speed by braking, it is still adding energy to the battery, so the net kinetic + battery energy is increasing.  Gravity is doing positive work on the car.  In contrast when it climbs up a hill it loses energy to gravity, even if it maintains a constant speed by using its battery, the net kinetic energy + battery energy is decreasing.  Gravity is doing negative work on the car.\n",

    "## Dot product properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start this lab, we need to review some important properties of dot products.  These properties are important for understanding work and they are important for some \"surface integrals\" we will encounter later in the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two vectors $\\vec{d}$ which will represent a \"displacement\" of an object and $\\vec{F}$ which will represent a \"force\" acting on that object, then their dot product can be calculated by $ \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{F} = d_x F_x + d_y F_y + d_z F_z$.  However, through a seemingly amazing coincidence, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{F} = \\|\\vec{d}\\| \\: \\| \\vec{F} \\| \\cos(\\theta)$$\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.  When $\\theta=0$, the movement and the force are in the same direction.  When $\\theta = \\pi$ they are in opposite directions, and when $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$ they are orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many important applications where we care about how much of $\\vec{d}$ points in the same direction as $\\vec{F}$.  To make it clear what we mean by this, we will write $\\vec{d}$ as a sum of two vectors.  The first vector is parallel to $\\vec{F}$.  The second vector is perpendicular to $\\vec{F}$.  The dot product will help us find these two vectors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will write \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{d} = \\alpha \\vec{F} + \\vec{d}^\\perp$$ \n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a scalar and $\\vec{d}^\\perp$ is a vector perpendicular to $\\vec{F}$.  Both $\\alpha$ and $\\vec{d}^\\perp$ are currently unknown values that we can find.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell shows an example with $\\vec{F}$ and $\\vec{d}$ and then the associated two vectors $\\alpha \\vec{F}$, and $\\vec{d}^\\perp$.  You don't need to immediately understand the calculations used to find $\\alpha \\vec{F}$ and $\\vec{d}^\\perp$.  This is just intended to demonstrate that we can assume $\\vec{d}$ is the sum of two such vectors.\n"

Given that there are no perpetual motion machines, comment on why real-life force fields that don't require energy input, such as gravity and fields from electric charge can't rotate like this.  (the magnetic field from an electric current does rotate.  However, creating the electric current requires the use of energy, and this means that while the object can get an arbitrary amount of energy, it requires the use of even more energy to maintain the necessary current)."
