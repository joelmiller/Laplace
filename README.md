It is based on chapter 1 of the MAT2VCA text compiled by Katherine Seaton in 2008, which itself was based on subject texts she wrote for
Vector Calculus in 2003 and for Partial Differential Equations in 1998.

Acknowledgements are due to the late and respected Professor Ed Smith, who set up the subjects and wrote the original notes, and also to Graham Byrnes, John Roberts, Peter Forrester and David McLaren. Some minor corrections have been made in the 2016 and 2017 editions by Phil Broadbridge, and for the 2020
edition by Joel Miller.

This version is being updated by Joel C. Miller using to align it with the current order of the subject material.  It is being created with `jupyter-book` because of a long-term aim to incorporate interactive code.
