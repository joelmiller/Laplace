    "In this lab we will gain experience with parametrizing lines and circles.  We will mostly think of these as sitting within the $xy$ plane, but more generally they could be sitting within a higher dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines and circles and many other curves are 1-dimensional objects.  We can mark a numberline along a curve, so that each point on the curve is associated with a numerical value, which we can call $t$.  Then the $x$, $y$ (and possibly $z$) coordinates can be thought of as functions of $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, it's useful to think of an object moving along the curve in time in which case $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ give the coordinates of the object at each time $t$.  For example, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a vehicle driving through a city can be thought of as functions of time.  At each time $t$, the function $x(t)$ gives the corresponding $x$ coordinate and $y(t)$ gives the $y$ coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, it may be useful to think of the distance $s$ along the curve from some starting point.  Then $x(s)$ and $y(s)$ give the coordinates of the position on the curve that is distance $s$ from the 'start'.  We can think of this using a moving vehicle analogy as well.  If we give directions like like \"follow the road for 1.5km\" \\- if we know the path then the distance $s$ tells us exactly what $x$ and $y$ coordinate the vehicle has reached, so we can think of $x(s)$ and $y(s)$ as functions of $s$.\n"
