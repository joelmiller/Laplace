    "To illustrate what's happening, let's assume $a$ and $b$ are positive and consider the following square with side length $a+b$.  The area of the square is $(a+b)^2$.  However, you can divide the square into 4 pieces: a square of side $a$ (and area $a^2$), a square of side $b$ (and area $b^2$), and two rectangles of sides $a$ and $b$ (with area $ab$).  \n",
