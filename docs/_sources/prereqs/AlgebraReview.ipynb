    "# How to improve your prerequisite skills\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever played a sport, you probably know that there are certain skills that are needed to reach the next level.  You also know that to master a skill, you need repetition.  It's not enough to watch the coach demonstrate a technique and then move on.  It's not enough to play a video game where your digital avatar can do it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to do it yourself until you master it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone an athlete moves up to a higher level and discovers that they are missing skills that are expected.  To succeed, they need to do extra work to master the missing skills while simultaneously working on the new things their coach is teaching.  This is very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many students who arrive in Vector Calculus but are missing important Algebra or single variable Calculus skills.  They need to master these while learning the new Vector Calculus material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, if you're in this position, you have a chance to improve your missing skills before the semester starts.\n",

    "## Recipe for mastering Algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a somewhat exaggerated recipe for how to get your Algebra skills ready.  This is not something you should expect to do in a weekend unless you have previously mastered Algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Order an Algebra workbook.\n",
    "2. Set a pot of water on the stove on medium heat\n",
    "3. When the water boils, place your calculator or any other device that you use to do Algebra for you into the pot.\n",
    "5. Add large amounts of salt.\n",
    "6. Stir vigorously until it returns to a boil\n",
    "7. Boil for 10 minutes and remove from heat.\n",
    "8. Place all other distracting devices in silent mode in a separate room.\n",
    "9. Work through the workbook in detail.\n",
    "   - Do not be afraid to seek out help from others when you encounter difficulties.\n",
    "   - Place your focus on developing fluency in the skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "(I don't actually mean for you to follow steps 2-7.  They are meant to illustrate the fact that developing a dependence on calculators and having frequent interruptions while practicing skills has harmed many students.)\n",
