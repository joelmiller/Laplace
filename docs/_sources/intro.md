# MAT2VCA - Vector Calculus

## LaTrobe University 

This text is still under development, and should only be used for Chapter 1 (Laplace Transform) and the material on LaGrange Multipliers in Chapter 2 (added to the subject in 2025) and for the computer labs (Currently Chapter 4).  The original text is available on LMS as a pdf document.

This text is based on the text for MAT2VCA compiled by Katherine Seaton in 2008, which itself was based on subject texts she wrote for
Vector Calculus in 2003 and for Partial Differential Equations in 1998.  

Acknowledgements are due to the late and respected Professor Ed Smith, who set up the subjects and wrote the original notes, and also to Graham Byrnes, John Roberts, Peter Forrester and David McLaren. Some minor corrections have been made in the 2016 and 2017 editions by Phil Broadbridge, and for the 2020
edition by Joel Miller.

This version is being updated by Joel C. Miller using to align it with the current order of the subject material and to give a more opportunities for interaction.  It is being created with `jupyter-book` because of a long-term aim to incorporate interactive code.

The copyright for the material in these notes resides with the authors, the Department of Mathematics and with La Trobe University, and as such reproduction of this material may be done only with their express permission. 

The 2025 year is the first year this version will be used.  There will almost certainly be typos, including possibly Algebra errors.  There will also be statements that will be unclear and can be improved.
