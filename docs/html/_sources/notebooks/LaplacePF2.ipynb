    "\n",
    "When $\\tilde{f}(s) = \\frac{p(s)}{q(s)}$ where $q(s)$ is cubic or higher order the process is similar.  We must again factor $q(s)$.  It is likely that we will be able to identify some of the factors of $q(s)$ directly by observing how $q(s)$ was constructed, but otherwise we may need to use more complicated methods to find the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume for now that we know the factorization of $q(s)$.  In general the factorization may have multiple real roots, multiple complex roots, and multiple repeated roots.  We will **assume** that no complex roots are repeated, so only the real roots may be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to when $q(s)$ is quadratic, we will write $q(s)$ as a partial fraction deocmposition that depends on how $q(s)$ factors.  We will start with examples and then give the full approach.\n",
